2 PRACTICE - NLP -  DEEP Learning - Theory - Word2Vec and Glove Practice with news and wikipedia data

3 Theory - NLP - RNN with Deep Learning
            - vanishing and exploding gradients
            - Short-term memory
            - Long-short term memory (LSTM) : forget gate, input gate, cell gate (memory), output gate
            - Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) : update gate, reset gate
